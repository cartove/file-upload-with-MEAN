Description
===========
This demo shows how to use file upload with angular.js, node.js, express.js and mongoDb.

Everything that is not needed, is left out. You cannot just copy 'n paste this into your project.


Setup
=====
Installation for development
----------------------------

Clone the repository with
```
git clone https://github.com/theotheu/passport-with-angular-partials.git ~/workspaces/file-uploadDemo
```

Go to the working directory
```
cd ~/workspaces/file-uploadDemo
```

*Make sure you have a directory client/images/uploads.*


Configuration
----------
Copy ```config.js.default``` to ```config.js```.
```sh
cp ~/workspaces/file-uploadDemo/server/config/config.js.default ~/workspaces/file-uploadDemo/server/config/config.js
```

Change the database, port and emailaddress.

Example
```javascript
module.exports = {
    development: {
        db: 'mongodb://localhost/p123456',
        port: 3000,
        mailTo: "you@example.com",
        AccessControlAllowMethods: "GET,PUT,POST,DELETE",
        allowedDomains: "*"
    }
    , test: {
    }
    , production: {
    }
}
```

Install node modules
----------
The archive is without the node modules.

Install with
```sh
cd ~/workspaces/file-uploadDemo/server
npm install
```

supervisor
----------
Make sure you have supervisor installed - with the global option

```sh
npm install -g supervisor
```

Use it with
```sh
supervisor --no-restart-on error server.js
```

Instructions to prepare a deployment
===================================

* Verify that you have a explanatory README.md
* Make an export of your data with mongodump ```mongodump --collection collection --db test --out ~/workspaces/file-uploadDemo/data``` (see http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.2/reference/mongodump/)
* Create in your repository a directory ```data``` where you put your export, with import instructions.
* Push the repository
